'''Happy Number: A Happy Number is a positive integer that, when you repeatedly replace
the number by the sum of the squares of its digits and continue the process, eventualy
reaches 1. If the process never reaches 1 but instead loops endlessly in a cycle, the number
is not a Happy Number.
For example:
19 is a Happy Number because:1(square)+ 9(square)= 82
8(square)+2(square) = 68
6(square) 8(square)+ = 100
1(square)+0(square) +0(square) = 1

The process reaches 1, so 19 is a Happy Number.'''
