'''Fibonacci sequence:
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two
preceding ones, typicaly starting with 0 and 1. So, the sequence begins with 0 and 1, and
the next number is obtained by adding the previous two numbers. This pattern continues
indefinitely, generating a sequence that looks like this:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, and so on.
Mathematicaly, the Fibonacci sequence can be defined using the folowing recurrence
relation:
𝐹(0) = 0 𝐹(1) = 1 𝐹(𝑛) = 𝐹(𝑛 − 1) + 𝐹(𝑛 − 2)𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑛 > 1 '''

nterms = int(input("How many terms? "))
# first two terms
n1, n2 = 0, 1
count = 0
# check if the number of terms is valid
if nterms <= 0:
  print("Please enter a positive integer")
# if there is only one term, return n1
elif nterms == 1:
   print("Fibonacci sequence upto",nterms,":")
   print(n1)
# generate fibonacci sequence
else:
   print("Fibonacci sequence:")
   while count < nterms:
    print(n1)
    nth = n1 + n2
# update values
    n1 = n2   
    n2 = nth
    count += 1
