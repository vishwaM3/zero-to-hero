#It is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits, each raised to a power equal to the number of digits in the number.For example, let's consider the number 153:It has three digits (1, 5, and 3).If we calculate + , we get , which is equal to .13 + 53 33 1 + 125 + 27 153 So, 153 is an Armstrong number because it equals the sum of its digits raised to the powerof the number of digits in the number.Another example is 9474:It has four digits (9, 4, 7, and 4) If we calculate 94 44 74 44 6561 + 256 + 2401 + 256 + + + , we get , which is also equal to .m Therefore, 9474 is an Armstrong number as wel
